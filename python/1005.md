# [Python Strings](https://www.w3schools.com/python/python_strings.asp)

- strings in Python are arrays of bytes representing `unicode` characters.
``` python
a = "Hello, Angela"
print(a[7])

# strings == > array
# index begins with 0

A
```
- Strings are Arrays ==> acces the elemet of arrays
- Python does not have a character data type, a single character is simply a string with a length of 1

``` python
a = "Hello, Angela!"
print(a[4])

# strings == > array
# index begins with 0

0
```
- Looping Through a String

``` python
for x in "Dadalong":
  print(x)
  
  A
  n
  g
  e
  l
  a
```
- String Length:To get the length of a string, use the `len()`function.
``` python
a = "Hello, Angela!"
print(len(a))
# wrong: print(length(a))

14
```

QUIZ:tell me how many char appear in "dshdsjadhsjahdsjhdecwej  dsaksdjl"

``` python
a = "dshdsjadhsjahdsjhdecwej  dsaksdjl"
print(len(a))
# wrong: print(length(a))
# 33 = 31 letter 2 space
```
- Check String:To check if a certain phrase or character is present in a string, we can use the keyword `in`.
- keyword `in` vs `if`
- True or False

``` python
txt = "The best things in life are free!HDJSAdhjs  dhsjahd32 dsaDJHSajdh "
# print("free" in txt) == > True
# print("HDJSAdhj" in txt) == > True
print("HJSAdh" in txt)  # False

False
```

``` python
txt = "The best things in life are free!HDJSAdhjs  dhsjahd32 dsaDJHSajdh "
if "HDJSAdhj" in txt:
  print("Yes, 'HDJSAdhj' is present.")
  
  Yes, 'HDJSAdhj' is present.
```

``` python
txt = "The best things in life are free!HDJSAdhjs  dhsjahd32 dsaDJHSajdh "
if "HJSAdhj" in txt:
  print("Yes, 'HJSAdhj' is present.")
```
- Negative Indexing
``` python
b = "Hello, Dadalong!"
print(b[-5:-2])
# -2 not included

gel
```
- Python - Modify Strings
- The `upper()` method returns the string in upper case:
- The lower() method returns the string in lower case
``` python
b = "Hello, Angela!"
print(b.upper())

HELLO, ANGELA!
```
- Remove Whitespace with `strip()` method
- The strip() method removes any whitespace from the beginning or the end
``` python
b = " Hello, Angela! "
print(b.strip())

Hello, Angela!
```
- The `replace()`method replaces a string with another string
- `separator`
``` python
b = " Hello, Angela! "
print(b.replace("o", "w"))

Hellw, Angela!
```

```python
b = " Hello, Angela!! "
print(b.split(","))

[' Hello', ' Angela! ']
```

```python
b = " Hello, Angela! "
print(b.split("D"))

[ Hello, Angela! ']
```

- String Concatenation:To concatenate, or combine, two strings you can use the `+` operator.
```python
a = "Hello"
b = " , "
c = "Angela"
d = a + b + c
print(d)

Hello , Angela
```

- Python - Format - Strings
```python
age = 21
txt = "My name is Angela, and I am {}"
print(txt.format(age))

My name is Angela, and I am 21
```


```python
quantity = 3
itemno = 567
price = 49.95
myorder = "I want {2} pieces of item {0} for {1} dollars."
print(myorder.format(quantity, itemno, price))

I want 49.95 pieces of item 3 for 567 dollars.
```
- String Methods

```python
txt = "hello, you look awesome today."

x = txt.capitalize()

print (x)

Hello, you look awesome today.
```


```python
txt = "Hello, My name is Angela!"

x = txt.casefold()

print(x)

hello, my name is angela!
```
